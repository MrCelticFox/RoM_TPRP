A Transport Portal Route Planner for Runes of Magic


The start of a project for Runes of Magic players who frequently use the transport portal system to travel long disances. As it is not always possible to go directly from A to B, this projet aims the optimise the steps taken in between.


There are currently two planned options:
  - cheapest route (least amount of gold for total journey)
  - quickest route (fewest steps, may not be cheapest way)
  
  
To read in the data from the JSON file, I am using this project:
https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/
so you will need to include that if you're forking this project.
